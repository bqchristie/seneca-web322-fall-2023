# HTTP Protocol

## An overview

Imagine you want to send a letter to your friend, but your friend lives far away. You can't just hand them the letter, so you need to send it through the mail. The HTTP protocol is a bit like sending letters, but for computers on the internet.

Here's how it works:

1. **Addressing**: Just like you need your friend's address to send them a letter, your computer needs the address of the computer it wants to talk to on the internet. This address is called a "URL" (Uniform Resource Locator). It's like the street address for a website.

2. **Request**: When your computer wants to get something from a website, like a web page or a picture, it sends a special message called an "HTTP request." This request says, "Hey, I want this specific thing from that website."

3. **Server**: The computer that has the website you want is called a "server." It's like the post office that receives your letter. When the server gets your request, it knows what you want.

4. **Response**: After the server understands your request, it sends back a reply called an "HTTP response." It's like when your friend writes you a letter back. This response includes what you asked for, like a web page, a picture, or some information.

5. **Content**: The HTTP response not only contains what you requested but also some extra information. It might say, "Here's the web page you wanted, and it's in HTML format," or "Here's the picture, and it's in JPEG format." This helps your computer understand how to show or use what it received.

6. **Communication**: Your computer and the server keep sending messages back and forth like this, just like you and your friend writing letters to each other until you have everything you need.

7. **Status Codes**: Sometimes, things don't go perfectly. Servers can send special numbers called "status codes" to tell your computer if everything is okay (like 200 for "OK") or if there's a problem (like 404 for "Not Found").

So, HTTP is like the language that computers on the internet use to request and share information with each other, just like you use words to communicate with your friend through letters. It helps them understand what to send and how to send it so you can see websites, pictures, and more on your computer.
