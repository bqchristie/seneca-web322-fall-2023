# Week Two Notes

## Steps for setting up Git

1. Make sure you have a github account
2. Create a new repository called: web322-[firstname]-[lastname] (i.e. web322-bruce-christie)
3. From your computer terminal application go to the folder where you put code.

```
git clone https://github.com/bqchristie/web322-bruce-christie.git
cd web32-bruce-christie
git checkout -b assignment-1
git push --set-upstream origin assignment-1
```


After this you will hava repo with a branch named assignment-1 (verify from github).    We will do all of the assignment one work in here.  At the end of the week we will merge bakc to the main branch.
