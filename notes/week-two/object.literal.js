/**
 * Object Literal Notation - basically anything inside {}
 * 
 * Object literal notation is a way to create objects using a 
 * simple and straightforward syntax that resembles a list of key-value pairs. 
 * 
 * Imagine you have a bunch of information you want to store about something, 
 * like a person or a car. Object literal notation lets you organize this
 * information neatly.
 * 
 * 1. create an object
 * 2. add properties
 * 3. add method with function
 * 4. add method with this
 * 6. access properties with []
 *
